# World Happiness Data Visualisation Project  
Assessment Project – Data Visualisation (CMP-X302-0)

## Overview  
This repository contains the full implementation of the Data Visualisation coursework, including a structured Jupyter Notebook, dataset, and supporting files.  
The analysis is based on the **World Happiness Report** dataset and follows a complete workflow covering data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), research question formulation, visualisation design, and interpretation.

## Notebook Features  
- Clear workflow with Markdown explanations and code separation
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Formulation and justification of research questions
- High-quality visualisations using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- Interpretation of patterns and insights
- Reproducible and executable code suitable for university machines (Python 3.10+)

## Requirements  
The notebook uses common Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

## Assessment Deliverables
This repository contributes to the following required components:

- 2,500-word report
- Python implementation (.ipynb) included in this repo
- 5–7 minute screen recording demonstrating code execution

These materials collectively meet the assessment criteria defined in the module brief.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the World Happiness Report  
It must be stored in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook when executed on university machines.

## Academic Integrity
The project follows Roehampton University guidelines on the ethical use of AI tools. 
Any AI assistance used in the creation of the project must be acknowledged in the report submission.
