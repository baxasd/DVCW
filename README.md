## 🌍 Global Happiness Analysis — Data Visualisation Project

This project explores patterns and inequalities in global happiness using the **World Happiness Report** dataset. The analysis focuses on how economic, social, and institutional factors relate to national happiness scores across different regions of the world.

The work was completed as part of the **Data Visualisation (CMP-X302-0)** module and combines data preparation, exploratory analysis, and carefully designed visualisations to support data-driven storytelling.

### 📊 Project Overview

The notebook:

* Cleans and prepares the World Happiness dataset for analysis
* Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and distributions
* Formulates research questions grounded in observed patterns
* Uses multiple visualisation techniques (scatter plots, distributions, correlation views, and comparative plots) to analyse relationships between happiness and its contributing factors
* Interprets findings in a global and regional context, highlighting disparities and limitations within the data

All visualisations are produced using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, with attention to colour theory, readability, and narrative clarity.

> ⚠️ The notebook and dataset must remain in the same directory for correct execution, as required by the assessment specification.

### ▶️ How to Run

1. Ensure Python **3.10+** is installed
2. Install required libraries:

   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```
3. Place `world-happiness-report.csv` in the same folder as the notebook
4. Open and run `Z22590018.ipynb` sequentially in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes Addressed

* Selection and application of appropriate visualisation techniques
* Evaluation of visual effectiveness for analytical tasks
* Development of clear, data-driven visual narratives

### 📌 Notes

This repository contains the **artefact component** of the coursework. A written report and screen-recorded code presentation accompany this submission separately, as per module requirements.
